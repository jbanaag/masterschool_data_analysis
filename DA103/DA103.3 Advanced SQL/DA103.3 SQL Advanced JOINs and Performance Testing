/* DA103.3 SQL Advanced JOINs and Performance Testing */
/* 3. Quiz: FULL OUTER JOIN*/
/* This type of question is rare, but FULL OUTER JOIN is perfect for it. In the following SQL Explorer, 
write a query with FULL OUTER JOIN to fit the above described Parch & Posey scenario 
(selecting all of the columns in both of the relevant tables, accounts and sales_reps) then answer 
the subsequent multiple-choice quiz.*/
SELECT
	a.name AS account_name,
	s.name AS sales_rep
  FROM 
  	accounts AS a
FULL OUTER JOIN 
	sales_reps AS s
	ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
-- can add this to find if there are NULLs
WHERE accounts.sales_rep_id IS NULL OR sales_reps.id IS NULL

/* 6. Quiz: JOINS with Comparison Operators
In the following SQL Explorer, write a query that left joins the accounts table and the sales_reps tables on 
each sale rep's ID number and joins it using the < comparison operator on accounts.primary_poc and 
sales_reps.name*/
SELECT
	a.name AS account_name,
	a.primary_poc,
	s.name AS sales_rep 
  FROM
  	accounts AS a 
  	LEFT JOIN 
  		sales_reps AS s
  	ON a.primary_poc < s.name
